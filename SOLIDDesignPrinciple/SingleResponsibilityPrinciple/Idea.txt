SingleResponsibilityPrinciple:

class Student	//developed 2021
{
//fields
//setter getters
//Include Requirement
}

Requirement: converting StudentObject to JSON //2023



If lots of requirement came and we are putting everything into single class
then there is issue.

SingleResponsibilityPrinciple suggest to separate unrelated implementation
and use separate classes for that.

Student class has to be only responsible for holding data related to properties.
Requirement1 implemtation shouldn't be there.

There has to be separate utility class for converting student object to JSON.
