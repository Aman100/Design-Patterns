Rule_5:
Invariants must be preserved:

State: An object can have multiple properties and value of properties defines
       state of an object.
let's say for all states of base class, particular condition is true, then that is
called as an Invariant property of that class. Something which cannot be varied.
Now if subclass introduces a feature which changes this, then the
LSP [Invariants must be preserved] rule is broken.

class SeniorCitizen
	For all instances of SeniorCitizen age is always>=60

Now if someone creates derived class of SeniorCitizen and introduces a functionaly
which allows SeniorCitizen to 50 then the Invariant rule of SeniorCitizen is 
voilated and hence application will break.

Rule_6:
History Rule:
When extending a base, the derived should not modify unmodifiable property.

Eg1: While creating an object, name is set and no setter method is provided
     change the name, and name is private / protected, which means that the
     base class states that name is not modifiable, and if derived introduced
     a functionality(Reflection, trace memory) which allows user of derived 
     to modify the name then LSP is broken.

Eg2: If a property is intially set to 0 (on creation of an object), then because
     of some events, the value is incremented. It is never decremented or set
     to 0.
     Then derived should not introduced a functionality that does otherwise, 
     means reset to 0 or decrement it. If the derived does that then LSP rule is
     broken.

Rule_7:
Rule related to throwing exception:
	If a function of base classed is throwing exception and it is redefined 
	in derived, then the function in derived should not throw / raise Exception
	that is beyond the boundary of Exception that might be raised by the 
	base class method.

SuperCoolException 
CustomException inherits SuperCoolException
CoolException inherits CustomException
BhaltaException

class Base:
	doSomething() method which will Raise CustomException.

Class Derived:public Base
	doSomething() is overriden and in some cases it raise 
		1. CustomException, CoolException (LSP rule is not voilated)
		2. SuperCoolException 	(LSP rule is voilated)
		3. BhaltaException	(LSP rule is voilated)
